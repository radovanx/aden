== Description ==

This plugin creates static html files from your dynamic WordPress blog.
When a page is rendered, php and mysql are used. Therefor, system needs RAM and CPU. 
If many visitors come to a site, system uses lots of RAM and CPU so page is rendered so slowly. 
In this case, you need a cache system not to render page again and again.
Cache system generates a static html file and saves. Other users reach to static html page.
<br><br>
Setup of this plugin is so easy. You don't need to modify .htacces file. It will modified automatically.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I know my blog is being cached? =
You need to refresh a page twice. If a page is cached, at the bottom of the page there is a text like "&lt;!-- WP Fastest Cache file was created in 0.330816984177 seconds, on 08-01-14 9:01:35 --&gt;".

= What does ".htaccess not found" warning mean? =
Wpfc does not create .htaccess automatically so you need to create empty one.

= How is "tmpWpfc" removed? =
When the cached files are deleted, they are moved to "tmpWpfc" instead of being deleted and a cron-job is set. Delete all files are so difficult for server so cron-job is set not to use a lot of CPU resources. Cron-job is set and it deletes 100 files every 5 minutes. When all files in "tmpWpfc" are deleted, cron-job is unset.

= How can stop caching for some pages? =
If you add &lt;!--[wpfcNOT]--&gt; into source coude, creating cache stops. You can find it on visual and text editor after opening Add New Post panel.

= Does Wpfc work with WPMU (Wordpress Multisite) properly? =
No. Wpfc does not support Wordpress Multisite yet.

= Does Wpfc work in "Subdirectory Install"? =
Yes. Wpfc supports "Subdirectory Install".

= Is this plugin compatible with CloudFlare? =
Yes, it is compatible with CloudFlare %100.

In this case, you need to look at the style files. You can see the minified css files.

= Is this plugin compatible with WP-Polls? =
Yes, it is compatible with WP-Polls %100.

Yes, it is compatible with Bulletproof Security %100.
